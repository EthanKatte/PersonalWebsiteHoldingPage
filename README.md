# PersonalWebsite Holding Page

This Repo is a host for Ethankatte.com and holds a temporary page I am using as a filler while the actual website is in development.
It was made using ThreeJS and is just a simple scene with a sphere and lighting. The sphere can be moved around by clicking and draggin on the screen.
